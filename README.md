# C++ Trie Tree Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Trie Tree data structure, designed for efficient word storage and retrieval. The Trie Tree is a tree-like data structure that is particularly useful for dictionary-related applications, auto-completion, and spell-checking.

## Features

- **Insertion and Deletion:** Add words along with their meanings to the Trie Tree. Delete words when necessary.
  
- **Search:** Look up the meaning of a word efficiently using the Trie Tree's search functionality.

- **Update:** Modify the meaning associated with a particular word.

- **Suggestions:** Get word suggestions based on a provided prefix, useful for autocomplete features.

- **Dictionary Loading:** Load an initial dictionary from a file (in this case, "Dictionary.txt").

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moeez-muslim/trie-tree-cpp.git
   ```

2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o trie_tree
   ```

3. Run the executable.
   ```bash
   ./trie_tree
   ```

4. Interact with the Trie Tree using the provided menu options.

Feel free to explore, modify, and integrate this Trie Tree implementation into your projects. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
